# Seismic WebGIS Platform

A lightweight web-based GIS application for real-time earthquake data monitoring and visualization. Originally developed as a learning project, this platform has been refactored and modernized to align with open geospatial standards (OGC) and to support applications such as hydrological or emergency response mapping.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Coming soon via GitHub Pages or Docker Compose.

## 🧭 Features

- Fetch real-time earthquake data from CENC (China Earthquake Networks Center)
- Store and manage spatial data with PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- Visualize seismic events on an interactive map (OpenLayers)
- Analyze patterns and display dynamic charts (ECharts)
- Responsive UI with Vue2 + Element UI
- Optional layer services via GeoServer or ArcGIS Server
